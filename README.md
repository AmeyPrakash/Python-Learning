# **Python Learning**

This is my personal repository for learning and practicing Python. I’m using it to explore basic concepts, write small programs, and experiment with ideas as I improve my coding skills.

Nothing here is meant to be perfect — it’s just my progress, mistakes, and experiments as I go.

## **What’s Inside :**

  - Simple Python scripts and exercises

  - Practice programs on topics like loops, conditionals, and functions

  - Small projects to understand concepts better

  - Notes and experiments from tutorials or random ideas

## **⚙️ Topics I’m Exploring**

  - Basics (variables, loops, data types)

  - Functions and modules

  - File handling

  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

  - Data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets)

  - A few mini projects for hands-on learning

## **🧠 Goal**

  - To build a strong foundation in Python and get comfortable writing real, working code — step by step
